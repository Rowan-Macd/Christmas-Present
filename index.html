    <h1>My plan was originally to make the heart on one side and on the other side I would write a cute message for you. However as I sat there thinking I started to realize problems with that idea. 
      Mainly that I wouldnt have space for all the things I want to tell you. I spend all day every single day thinking about you. 
      <br> <br>
      There is not a single second that you dont spend taking up all the space in my mind and because of this I have so so many things I wanted to write here for you.
      As i think of all the amazing things i could say to you all i can think about is how 
      beautiful, radiant, captivating, enchanting, adorable, lovely, irresistable, elegant, graceful, exquisite, charming, stunning, gorgeous, breathtaking, angelic, heartwarming, dazzling, sparkling, heavenly, mesmerizing, enamoring, lovable, kind, amazing, cute, thoughtful, caring, pretty, wonderful, incredible, sweet... 
      I can go on, all i can think about is you. Your splendor is ineffable.
