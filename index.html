  <!-- my text for her-->
  <h1>My plan was originally to make the heart on one side and on the other side I would write a cute message for you. However as I sat there thinking I started to realize problems with that idea. 
    Mainly that I wouldnt have space for all the things I want to tell you. I spend all day every single day thinking about you. 
    <br><br>
    There is not a single second that you dont spend taking up all the space in my mind and because of this I have so so many things I wanted to write here for you.
    As i think of all the amazing things i could say to you all i can think about is how 
    beautiful, radiant, captivating, enchanting, adorable, lovely, irresistable, elegant, graceful, exquisite, charming, stunning, gorgeous, breathtaking, angelic, heartwarming, dazzling, sparkling, heavenly, mesmerizing, enamoring, lovable, kind, amazing, cute, thoughtful, caring, pretty, wonderful, incredible, sweet... 
    I can go on, all i can think about is you. Your splendor is ineffable. 
    <br><br>
    Every second i spend with you I think i am in heaven because spending time with you is paradise and youre such an angel.
    <br><br>
    As I look into your eyes I get lost in the emmaculate beauty hidden behind them, for you are the first person I've met who's heart is as beautiful as their face.
    <br><br>
    Even though hours with you seem to pass in mere seconds every instant i spend in your arms fills me with enough happiness for a thousand life times. 
    <br><br>
    I would drive a million miles just to be with you and with how this year is going it seems like I might just do that before the end of the year.
    <br><br>
    Somehow my dreams only seem to start once ive woken up and started talking to you.
    <br><br>
    You are so sweet, like a nectar, which explains why I get so many butterflies arround you.
    <br><br>
    You somehow take all the thoughts raging in my mind and crush them all to one overwhelming thought so that all i can think about when youre arround is how much I Love You &lt;3
    <br><br>
    You outshine the morning sun. When you smile I fall appart and I thought I was so smart. - Alexander Hamilton the broadway musical
    <br><br> 
    Even if I have a house to return to at the end of the day, it will only truly feel like home with you.
